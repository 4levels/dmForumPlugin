      This is a sample sticked topic. It should be on top of the topic list, 
      even though more recent topics exist. 
      Only users with moderator privilege can stick or unstick it (1 is a moderator).

      If you see no alert, it means that your output escaping is turned on<br>
      <script>alert('you should turn output escaping on to prevent XSS attacks')</script>
